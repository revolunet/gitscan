OpenLawEd
=========

A collaborative environment empowering a community to translate law into an open model.

An open model is not an expert system, nor should it be. It is a mere commoditization of the computation of conditions of application, and effects, of law in any given situation. This also means that it can not be only code. Otherwise, it would be a simple translation from one expert, opaque language to another.


Rationale
---------

### Value aka “why do this?”

Open models create social value.

Computing the effects of law allow for :

- **improved service** as expertise is commoditized and any actor may use it;
- **renewed social dialog** based on evidence and a common ontology (in the philosophical meaning);
- **simplification** as the administration becomes more self-conscious;
- **better informed decision-making** (be it for legislators or entities affected by the law).


### Impediments aka “why hasn't this been done yet?”

Society has coped with this complexity through specialist professions. The new, unbalancing facts are the global acceleration of change pace in society, leading to increased law production; and increased exigency from society through habituation to cheap and efficient digital tools outsourcing expertise.

> For years, if you had weird marks on your skin, you'd go straight to the doc. Now, you'll first google for your symptoms. And you've become so accustomed to this, you feel like the administration is out-of-touch with the current world.

The specific case of law open models and the lateness of their emergence compared to other complexity-erasing tools is capitalistic drive. The market has no incentive to solve the root causes of complexity, but only to benefit from temporary solutions to it.

> No pharmaceutical industry will ever prevent you from getting ill, as they benefit from healing you.

Thus, it is the responsibility of the public, be it through civil society or through the State, to reduce the complexity.

> Only you and people in the same position as you have an interest in avoiding being sick in the first place.

This is getting done, but resources are scarce. There's a tremendous amount of complexity to treat in accumulated centuries of law. There has been many punctual tries at reducing it, but no systemic approach. Some states are now sponsoring open models, but mostly by mandating law and code experts to create an interactive model of the law.

> So much to do, so few people having time to work on it.


### Opportunity aka “what can we leverage to do this?”

Law is an expert language. Code is another expert language. People fluent in one usually aren't in the other. People fluent in neither are unable to contribute, even though they could feed the model with actual application data.

> If you're not a lawyer or a programmer, you can't help.

Yet, the whole society would benefit from an open model. Thus, everyone would have an interest in contributing. We just have to make it clear how contributions can be made.

> Yet, you would benefit from helping.


### Solution aka “let's do this”

A tool to crowdsource open models.

> Allow anyone to contribute.

We won't be able to crowdsource everything (e.g. expert interpretation, actual coding), but we can capture much more value from the crowd than the current epsilon.

> This doesn't mean everyone will code, but everyone will be able to give a hand at their level.
