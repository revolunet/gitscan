DDS cross-simulator
===================

Use the test acceptance format from the [mes-aides](https://github.com/sgmap/mes-aides-ui) multi-simulator to use simulators from other administrations.

Status
------

**This is currently a PoC.** Only a specific case for the CAF simulator is treated. At the time of writing, it does not even cover the whole user journey.

Installation
------------

This “cross-simulator” is just a [Watai](https://github.com/MattiSG/Watai) test suite.

You'll need to install Watai and the Selenium server. This is all covered in the [Watai installation guide](https://github.com/MattiSG/Watai#installing).

Once you have installed Watai, `clone` this repo, `cd` to it and run `watai .`.
