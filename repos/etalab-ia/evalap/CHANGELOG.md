- *(api)* Judge model must be unique in a set.
- Strip answer + think
- Fix multi-step agent loop generation if max_steps is reached.

## [0.3.1] - 2025-04-02

### üöÄ Features

- [API] Support Anthropic, Openai, Mistral and Albert providers for judge models `judge_model` parameter in experiments (models are fetch from the openai api v1/models endpoints)
- [SCRIPTS] ADD convenient scripts to run experiment from an isolated environment (e.g. like cortex, [see the tutorial](https://tchap.gouv.fr/#/room/!GeUSclgFhhSSkwiExz:agent.dinum.tchap.gouv.fr/$BoFMFX0xNyz0FFIIaFUzdIxyshhulBWPYZxP1q9Zm5s?via=agent.dinum.tchap.gouv.fr) )

### üîß Improvements

- [UI] Add a special card for orphan experiments at the bottom of the experiments list.
- [UI] Order the experiment set from the newest first
- [UI] Remove old confusing experiments menu in favor of only the experiment sets menu (renamed simply experiments)
