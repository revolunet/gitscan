## üìù Description

This project processes public data made available by various administrations in order to facilitate access to vectorized and ready-to-use public data for AI applications in the public sector.
It includes scripts for downloading, processing, embedding, and inserting this data into a PostgreSQL database, and facilitates its export via various means.

## üí° Tutorial

### ñ£ò Method 1 : Airflow

#### Installing and configuring dependencies

1. Run the initial deployment script:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x ./scripts/initial_deployment.sh
   ./scripts/initial_deployment.sh
   ```
  
2. Set up the environment variables in a [`.env`](.env) file based on the example in [`.env.example`](.env.example).
   > The `AIRFLOW_UID` variable must be obtained by executing:
    ```bash
    echo $(id -u)
    ```
   > The `JWT_TOKEN` variable will be obtained later by using the Airflow API. Just leave it for now.

#### Initialize Airflow and PostgreSQL (PgVector) containers

1. Run the [`containers_deployment`](./scripts/containers_deployment) script :
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x ./scripts/containers_deployment.sh
   ./scripts/containers_deployment.sh
   ```

2. Export [`.env`](.env) variables :
   ```bash
   export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
   ```

3. Make sure to remove the PostgreSQL (PgVector) volume:
   ```bash
   docker compose down -v
   ```
   > ‚ö†Ô∏è This operation will delete all volumes ! 

4. Use the Airflow API to obtain the `JWT_TOKEN` variable:
   ```bash
   curl -X 'POST' \
   'http://localhost:8080/auth/token' \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -d "{\"username\": \"${_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_USERNAME}\", \"password\": \"${_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_PASSWORD}\"}"
   ```

5. Define the `JWT_TOKEN` variable in the [`.env`](.env) file with the obtained `access_token`.

#### Optional : Configure Tchap logging 

To receive real-time notifications about DAG execution (start, success, failure) in a Tchap room, you need to configure an Apprise connection in Airflow.
> If you don't want to, you can just remove the following lines in each DAG located in [`airflow_config/dags/`](airflow_config/dags/) :

      on_execute_callback=get_start_notifier(),
      on_success_callback=get_success_notifier(),
      on_failure_callback=get_failure_notifier(),

Otherwise : 

1.  Navigate to the Airflow UI (usually `http://localhost:8080`).
2.  Go to **Admin > Connections**.
3.  Click the **`+`** icon to add a new record.
4.  Fill in the connection form with the following details:
    *   **Connection Id**: `TchapNotifier`
    *   **Connection Type**: `Apprise`
    *   **Extra fields > config**: Construct the Apprise URL for Matrix using your environment variables, following this format:
        ```
        {"path": "matrixs://<TCHAP_ACCOUNT_TOKEN>@<TCHAP_SERVER>/<TCHAP_ROOM_TOKEN>/?format=markdown", "tag": "alerts"}
        ```
        -   Replace `<TCHAP_ACCOUNT_TOKEN>` with the value from your `.env` file.
        -   Replace `<TCHAP_SERVER>` with the server hostname from your `.env` file (e.g., `matrix.agent.dinum.tchap.gouv.fr`, **without** the `https://` prefix).
        -   Replace `<TCHAP_ROOM_TOKEN>` with the room ID from your `.env` file.

5.  Click **Save**.

Airflow will now use this connection to send formatted notifications to your specified Tchap room.

#### Downloading, Processing and Uploading Data

You are now ready to use Airflow and execute DAGs that are available.
Each dataset has its own DAG and a [`DAG_Controller`](./airflow_config/dags/dag_controller.py) is defined to manage all datasets DAGs and their execution order.

### </> Method 2 : Use local CLI

#### Installing Dependencies

1. Install the required apt dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y $(cat config/requirements-apt-container.txt)
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv  # Create the virtual environment
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
   ```

3. Install the required python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

> Installing in development mode (`-e`) allows you to use the `mediatech` command and modify the code without reinstalling.

> **Note:** Make sure your environment is properly configured before continuing.

#### PostgreSQL (PgVector) Database Configuration

1. Set up the environment variables in a [`.env`](.env) file based on the example in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

2. Start the PostgreSQL container with Docker:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d postgres
   ```

3. Check that the `pgvector_container` container is running:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

#### Downloading, Processing and Uploading Data

##### Using the `mediatech` Command

After installation, the `mediatech` command is available globally and replaces `python main.py`:

> If you encounter issues with the `mediatech` command, you can still use `python main.py` instead.

The [`main.py`](main.py) file is the main entry point of the project and provides a command-line interface (CLI) to run each step of the pipeline separately.  
You can use it as follows:

```bash
mediatech <command> [options]
```
or 

```bash
python main.py <command> [options]
```

Command examples:
- View help:
  ```bash
  mediatech --help
  ```
- Create PostgreSQL tables:  
  ```bash
  mediatech create_tables --model BAAI/bge-m3
  ```
- Download all files listed in [`data_config.json`](config/data_config.json):  
  ```bash
  mediatech download_files --all
  ```
- Download files from the `service_public` source:  
  ```bash
  mediatech download_files --source service_public
  ```
- Download and process all files listed in [`data_config.json`](config/data_config.json):  
  ```bash
  mediatech download_and_process_files --all --model BAAI/bge-m3
  ```
- Process all data:  
  ```bash
  mediatech process_files --all --model BAAI/bge-m3
  ```
- Split a table into subtables based on different criteria (see [`main.py`](main.py)):  
  ```bash
  mediatech split_table --source legi
  ```
- Export PostgreSQL tables to parquet files:  
  ```bash
  mediatech export_tables --output data/parquet
  ```
- Upload parquet datasets to the Hugging Face repository:
  ```bash
  mediatech upload_dataset --input data/parquet/service_public.parquet --dataset-name service-public
  ```


Run `mediatech --help` in your terminal to see all available options, or check the code directly in [`main.py`](main.py).


##### Alternative Usage with `python main.py`

If you prefer to use the Python script directly, you can always use:

```bash
python main.py <command> [options]
```

Examples:
```bash
python main.py download_files
python main.py create_tables --model BAAI/bge-m3
python main.py process_files --all --model BAAI/bge-m3
```
##### Using the [`update.sh`](update.sh) Script

The [`update.sh`](update.sh) script allows you to run the entire data processing pipeline: downloading, table creation, vectorization, and export.  
To run it, execute the following command from the project root:

```bash
./scripts/update.sh
```

This script will:
- Wait for the PostgreSQL database to be available,
- Create or update the necessary tables in the PostgreSQL database,
- Download public files listed in [`data_config.json`](config/data_config.json),
- Process and vectorize the data,
- Export the tables in Parquet format,
- Upload the Parquet files to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/AgentPublic).
